Regular Expressions (Regex): One of the most powerful, widely applicable, and sometimes intimidating techniques in software engineering.  From validating email addresses to performing complex code refactors, regular expressions have a wide range of uses and are an essential entry in any software engineer's toolbox.

#### What is a regular expression?

A regular expression (or regex, or regexp) is a way to describe complex search patterns using sequences of characters.

The complexity of the specialized regex syntax, however, can make these expressions somewhat inaccessible.  For instance, here is a basic regex that describes any time in the 24-hour HH/MM format.

```text
\b([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5]\d)\b
```

If this looks complex to you now, don't worry, by the time we finish the tutorial understanding this expression will be trivial.

#### Learn once, write anywhere

Regular expressions can be used in virtually any programming language.  A knowledge of regex is very useful for validating user input, interacting with the Unix shell, searching/refactoring code in your favorite text editor, performing database text searches, and lots more.

In this tutorial, I'll attempt to give an provide an approachable introduction to regex syntax and usage in a variety of scenarios, languages, and environments.

[This web application](https://regex101.com) is my favorite tool for building, testing, and debugging regular expressions.  I highly recommend that you use it to test out the expressions that we'll cover in this tutorial.

The source code for the examples in this tutorial can be found at the Github repository here - [https://github.com/triestpa/You-Should-Learn-Regex](https://github.com/triestpa/You-Should-Learn-Regex)

## 0 - Match Any Number Line

We'll start with a very simple example - Match any line that only contains numbers.

```text
^[0-9]+$
```

<br>

Let's walk through this piece-by-piece.
- `^` - Signifies the start of a line.
- `[0-9]` - Matches any digit between 0 and 9
- `+` - Matches one or more instance of the preceding expression.
- `$` - Signifies the end of the line.

We could re-write this regex in pseudo-English as `[start of line][one or more digits][end of line]`.

Pretty simple right?

> We could replace `[0-9]` with `\d`, which will do the same thing (match any digit).

The great thing about this expression (and regular expressions in general) is that it can be used, without much modification, **in any programing language**.

To demonstrate we'll now quickly go through how to perform this simple regex search on a text file using 16 of the most popular programming languages.

We can use the following input file (`test.txt`) as an example.
```text
1234
abcde
12db2
5362

1
```

<br>

Each script will read the `test.txt` file, search it using our regular expression, and print the result (`'1234', '5362', '1'`) to the console.

        static void Main()
        {
            string text = File.ReadAllText(@"./test.txt", Encoding.UTF8);
            Regex regex = new Regex("^[0-9]+$", RegexOptions.Multiline);

<br>

#### 0.15 - Bash
```bash
#!bin/bash
grep -E '^[0-9]+$' test.txt
```

<br>

Writing out the same operation in sixteen languages is a fun exercise, but we'll be mostly sticking with Javascript and Python (along with a bit of Bash at the end) for the rest of the tutorial since these languages (in my opinion) tend to yield the clearest, most readable implementations.

## 1 - Year Matching

Let's go through another simple example - matching any valid year in the 20th or 21st centuries.

```text
\b(19|20)\d{2}\b
```

We're starting and ending this regex with `\b` instead of `^` and `$`.  `\b` represents a *word boundary*, or a space between two words.  This will allow us to match years within the text blocks (instead of on their own lines), which is very useful for search through, say, paragraph text.

- `\b` - Word boundary
- `(19|20)` - Matches either '19' or '20' using the OR (`|`) operand.
- `\d{2}` - Two digits, same as `[0-9]{2}`
- `\b` - Word boundary

> Note that `\b` differs from `\s`, the code for a whitespace character.  `\b` searches for a place where a word character is not followed or preceded by another word-character, so **it is searching for the absence of a word character**, whereas `\s` is searching explicitly for a space character.  `\b` is especially appropriate for cases where we want to match a specific sequence/word, but not the whitespace before or after it.

#### 1.0 - Real-World Example - Count Year Occurrences

We can use this expression in a Python script to find how many times each year in the 20th or 21st century is mentioned in a historical Wikipedia article.

```python
import re
import urllib.request
import operator

# Download wiki page
url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_history_of_World_War_II"
html = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()

# Find all mentioned years in the 20th or 21st century
regex = r"\b(?:19|20)\d{2}\b"
matches = re.findall(regex, str(html))

# Form a dict of the number of occurrences of each year
year_counts = dict((year, matches.count(year)) for year in set(matches))

# Print the dict sorted in descending order
for year in sorted(year_counts, key=year_counts.get, reverse=True):
  print(year, year_counts[year])
```

<br>

The above script will print each year, along the number of times it is mentioned.
```text
1941 137
1943 80
1940 76
1945 73
1939 71
...
```

<br>

## 2 - Time Matching

Now we'll define a regex expression to match any time in the 24-hour format (`MM:HH`, such as 16:59).

```text
\b([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5]\d)\b
```

- `\b` - Word boundary
- `[01]` - 0 or 1
- `?` - Signifies that the preceding pattern is optional.
- `[0-9]` - any number between 0 and 9
- `|` - `OR` operand
- `2[0-3]` - 2, followed by any number between 0 and 3 (i.e. 20-23)
- `:` - Matches the `:` character
- `[0-5]` - Any number between 0 and 5
- `\d` - Any number between 0 and 9 (same as `[0-9]`)
- `\b` - Word boundary

#### 2.0 - Capture Groups

You might have noticed something new in the above pattern - we're wrapping the hour and minute capture segments in parenthesis `( ... )`.  This allows us to define each part of the pattern as a **capture group**.

Capture groups allow us individually extract, transform, and rearrange pieces of each matched pattern.

#### 2.1 - Real-World Example - Time Parsing

For example, in the above 24-hour pattern, we've defined two capture groups - one for the hour and one for the minute.

We can extract these capture groups easily.

Here's how we could use Javascript to parse a 24-hour formatted time into hours and minutes.

```javascript
const regex = /\b([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5]\d)/
const str = `The current time is 16:24`
const result = regex.exec(str)
console.log(`The current hour is ${result[1]}`)
console.log(`The current minute is ${result[2]}`)
```

> The zeroth capture group is always the entire matched expression.

The above script will produce the following output.

```text
The current hour is 16
The current minute is 24
```

<br>

As an extra exercise, you could try modifying this script to convert 24-hour times to 12-hour (am/pm) times.

## 3 - Date Matching

Now let's match a `DAY/MONTH/YEAR` style date pattern.

```text
\b(0?[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])([\/\-])(0?[1-9]|1[012])\2(\d{4})
```

This one is a bit longer, but it should look pretty similar to what we've covered already.

- `(0?[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])` - Match any number between 1 and 31 (with an optional preceding zero)
- `([\/\-])` - Match the seperator `/` or `-`
- `(0?[1-9]|1[012])` - Match any number between 1 and 12
- `\2` - Matches the second capture group (the seperator)
- `\d{4}` - Match any 4 digit number (0000 - 9999)

The only new concept here is that we're using `\2` to match the second capture group, which is the divider (`/` or `-`).  This enables us to avoid repeating our pattern matching specification, and will also require that the dividers are consistent (if the first divider is `/`, then the second must be as well).

#### 3.0 - Capture Group Substitution

Using capture groups, we can dynamically reorganize and transform our string input.

The standard way to refer to capture groups is to use the `$` or `\` symbol, along with the index of the capture group (remember that the capture group element is the full captured text).

#### 3.1 - Real-World Example - Date Format Transformation

Let's imagine that we were tasked with converting a collection of documents from using the international date format style (`DAY/MONTH/YEAR`) to the American style (`MONTH/DAY/YEAR`)

We could use the above regular expression with a replacement pattern - `$3$2$1$2$4` or `\3\2\1\2\4`.

Let's break our capture groups down.
- $1 - First capture group: the day digits.
- $2 - Second capture group: the divider.
- $3 - Third capture group: the month digits.
- $4 - Fourth capture group: the year digits.

Our replacement pattern (`\3\2\1\2\4`) will simply swap the month and day content in the expression.

Here's how we could do this transformation in Javascript -

```javascript
const regex = /\b(0?[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])([ \/\-])(0?[1-9]|1[012])\2(\d{4})/
const str = `Today's date is 18/09/2017`
const subst = `$3$2$1$2$4`
const result = str.replace(regex, subst)
console.log(result)
```

<br>

The above script will print `Today's date is 09/18/2017` to the console.

Here's how the same script would look in Python -

```python
import re
regex = r'\b(0?[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])([ \/\-])(0?[1-9]|1[012])\2(\d{4})'
test_str = "Today's date is 18/09/2017"
subst = r'\3\2\1\2\4'
result = re.sub(regex, subst, test_str)
print(result)
```

<br>

## 4 - Email Validation

Regular expressions can also be useful for input validation.

```text
^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.\w{2,6}$
```

Above is an (overly simple) regular expression to match an email address.

- `^` - Start of input
- `[^@\s]` - Match any character except for `@` and whitespace `\s`
- `+` - 1+ times
- `@` - Match the '@' symbol
- `[^@\s]+` - Match any character except for `@` and whitespace), 1+ times
- `\.` - Match the '.' character.
- `\w{2,6}` - Match any word character (letter, digit, or underscore), 2-6 times
- `$` - End of input

#### 4.0 - Real-World Example - Validate Email
Let's say we wanted to create a simple Javascript function to check if an input is a valid email.

```javascript
function isValidEmail (input) {
  const regex = /^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.\w{2,6}$/g;
  const result = regex.exec(input)

  // If result is null, no match was found
  return !!result
}

const tests = [
  `test.test@gmail.com`, // Valid
  '', // Invalid
  `test.test`, // Invalid
  '@invalid@test.com', // Invalid
  'invalid@@test.com', // Invalid
  `gmail.com`, // Invalid
  `this is a test@test.com`, // Invalid
  `test.test@gmail.comtest.test@gmail.com` // Invalid
]

console.log(tests.map(isValidEmail))
```

The output of this script should be `[ true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false ]`.

> Note - In a real-world application, validating an email address using a regular expression is not enough for many situations, such as when a user signs up.  Once you have confirmed that the input text is an email address, you should always follow through with the standard practice of sending a confirmation/activation email.

#### 4.1 - Full Email Regex

This is a very simple example which ignores lots of very important email-validity edge cases, such as invalid start/end characters and consecutive periods.  I really don't recommend using the above expression in your applications; it would be best to instead use a reputable email-validation library or to track down a more complete email validation regex.

For instance, here's a more advanced expression from (the aptly named) [emailregex.com](http://emailregex.com/) which matches 99% of [RFC 5322](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5322.txt) compliant email addresses.

```
(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])
```

Yeah, we're not going to walk through that one.

## 5 - Code Comment Pattern Matching

One of the most useful ad-hoc uses of regular expressions can be code refactors.  Most code editors support regex-based find/replace operations.  A well-formed regex substitution can turn a tedious 30-minute busywork job into a beautiful single-expression piece of regex refactor wizardry.

Instead of writing scripts to perform these operations, try doing them natively in your text editor of choice.  Nearly every text editor supports regex based find-and-replace.

Here are a few guides for popular editors.

#### 5.0 - Extracting Single Line CSS Comments

What if we wanted to find all of the single-line comments within a CSS file?

CSS comments come in the form `/* Comment Here */`

To capture any *single-line* CSS comment, we can use the following expression.

```text
(\/\*+)(.*)(\*+\/)
```

- `\/` - Match `/` symbol (we have escape the `/` character)
- `\*+` - Match one or more `*` symbols (again, we have to escape the `*` character with `\`).
- `(.*)` - Match any character (besides a newline `\n`), any number of times
- `\*+` - Match one or more `*` characters
- `\/` - Match closing `/` symbol.

Note that we have defined three capture groups in the above expression: the opening characters (`(\/\*+)`), the comment contents (`(.*)`), and the closing characters (`(\*+\/)`).

#### 5.1 - Real-World Example - Convert Single-Line Comments to Multi-Line Comments

We could use this expression to turn each single-line comment into a multi-line comment by performing the following substitution.

```text
$1\n$2\n$3
```

Here, we are simply adding a newline `\n` between each capture group.

Try performing this substitution on a file with the following contents.

```css
/* Single Line Comment */
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

/*
 Multiline Comment
*/
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

/* Another Single Line Comment */
h2 {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

<br>

The substitution will yield the same file, but with each single-line comment converted to a multi-line comment.

```css
/*
 Single Line Comment
*/
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

/*
 Multiline Comment
*/
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

/*
 Another Single Line Comment
*/
h2 {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

<br>

#### 5.2 - Real-World Example - Standardize CSS Comment Openings

Let's say we have a big messy CSS file that was written by a few different people.  In this file, some of the comments start with `/*`, some with `/**`, and some with `/*****`.

Let's write a regex substitution to standardize all of the single-line CSS comments to start with `/*`.

In order to do this, we'll extend our expression to only match comments with *two or more* starting asterisks.

```text
(\/\*{2,})(.*)(\*+\/)
```

This expression very similar to the original.  The main difference is that at the beginning we've replaced `\*+` with `\*{2,}`.  The `\*{2,}` syntax signifies "two or more" instances of `*`.

To standardize the opening of each comment we can pass the following substitution.

```bash
/*$2$3
```

<br>

Let's run this substitution on the following test CSS file.
```css
/** Double Asterisk Comment */
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

/* Single Asterisk Comment */
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

/***** Many Asterisk Comment */
h2 {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

<br>

The result will be the same file with standardized comment openings.
```css
/* Double Asterisk Comment */
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

/* Single Asterisk Comment */
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

/* Many Asterisk Comment */
h2 {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

<br>

## 6 - URL Matching

Another highly useful regex recipe is matching URLs in text.

Here an example URL matching expression from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3809401/what-is-a-good-regular-expression-to-match-a-url).

```text
(https?:\/\/)(www\.)?(?<domain>[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6})(?<path>\/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\/+.~#?&=]*)?
```

- `(https?:\/\/)` - Match http(s)
- `(www\.)?` - Optional "www" prefix
- `(?<domain>[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}` - Match a valid domain name
- `\.[a-z]{2,6})` - Match a domain extension extension (i.e. ".com" or ".org")
- `(?<path>\/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\/+.~#?&=]*)?` - Match URL path (`/posts`), query string (`?limit=1`), and/or file extension (`.html`), all optional.

#### 6.0 - Named capture groups

You'll notice here that some of the capture groups now begin with a `?<name>` identifier.  This is the syntax for a *named capture group*, which makes the data extraction cleaner.

#### 6.1 - Real-World Example - Parse Domain Names From URLs on A Web Page

Here's how we could use named capture groups to extract the domain name of each URL in a web page using Python.

```python
import re
import urllib.request

html = str(urllib.request.urlopen("https://moz.com/top500").read())
regex = r"(https?:\/\/)(www\.)?(?P<domain>[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6})(?P<path>\/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\/+.~#?&=]*)?"
matches = re.finditer(regex, html)

for match in matches:
  print(match.group('domain'))
```

<br>

The script will print out each domain name it finds in the raw web page HTML content.
```text
...

## 7 - Command Line Usage

Regular expressions are also supported by many Unix command line utilities!  We'll walk through how to use them with `grep` to find specific files, and with `sed` to replace text file content in-place.

#### 7.0 - Real-World Example - Image File Matching With `grep`

We'll define another basic regular expression, this time to match image files.

```text
^.+\.(?i)(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$
```

- `^` - Start of line.
- `.+` - Match any character (letters, digits, symbols), expect for `\n` (new line), 1+ times.
- `\.` - Match the '.' character.
- `(?i)` - Signifies that the next sequence is case-insensitive.
- `(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)` - Match common image file extensions
- `$` - End of line


Here's how you could list all of the image files in your `Downloads` directory.

```bash
ls ~/Downloads | grep -E '^.+\.(?i)(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$'
```

- `ls ~/Downloads` - List the files in your downloads directory
- `|` - Pipe the output to the next command
- `grep -E` - Filter the input with regular expression

#### 7.1 - Real-World Example - Email Substitution With `sed`

Another good use of regular expressions in bash commands could be redacting emails within a text file.

This can be done quite using the `sed` command, along with a modified version of our email regex from earlier.

```bash
sed -E -i 's/^(.*?\s|)[^@]+@[^\s]+/\1\{redacted\}/g' test.txt
```

- `sed` - The Unix "stream editor" utility, which allows for powerful text file transformations.
- `-E` - Use extended regex pattern matching
- `-i` - Replace the file stream in-place
- `'s/^(.*?\s|)` - Wrap the beginning of the line in a capture group
- `[^@]+@[^\s]+` - Simplified version of our email regex.
- `/\1\{redacted\}/g'` - Replace each email address with `{redacted}`.
- `test.txt` - Perform the operation on the `test.txt` file.

We can run the above substitution command on a sample `test.txt` file.

```bash
My email is patrick.triest@gmail.com
```

<br>

Once the command has been run, the email will be redacted from the `test.txt` file.

```bash
My email is {redacted}
```

> Warning - This command will automatically remove all email addresses from any `test.txt` that you pass it, so be careful where/when you run it, since **this operation cannot be reversed**.  To preview the results within the terminal, instead of replacing the text in-place, simply omit the `-i` flag.

> Note - While the above command should work on most Linux distributions, macOS uses the BSD implementation is `sed`, which is more limited in its supported regex syntax.  To use `sed` on macOS with decent regex support, I would recommend installing the GNU implementation of `sed` with `brew install gnu-sed`, and then using `gsed` from the command line instead of `sed`.

## 8 - When Not To Use Regex

Ok, so clearly regex is a powerful, flexible tool.  Are there times when you should avoid writing your own regex expressions? *Yes!*

#### 8.0 - Language Parsing

Parsing structured languages, from English to Java to JSON, can be a real pain using regex expressions.

Writing your own regex expression for this purpose is likely to be an exercise in frustration that will result in eventual (or immediate) disaster when an edge case or minor syntax/grammar error in the data source causes the expression to fail.

Battle-hardened parsers are available for virtually all machine-readable languages, and [NLP tools](http://www.nltk.org/) are available for human languages - I strongly recommend that you use one of them instead of attempting to write your own.

#### 8.1 - Security-Critical Input Filtering and Blacklists

It may seem tempting to use regular expressions to filter user input (such as from a web form), to prevent hackers from sending malicious commands (such as SQL injections) to your application.

Using a custom regex expression here is unwise since it is very difficult to cover every potential attack vector or malicious command.  For instance, hackers can use [alternative character encodings to get around naively programmed input blacklist filters](http://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/URLEmbeddedAttacks.html).

This is another instance where I would strongly recommend using the well-tested libraries and/or services, along with [the use of whitelists instead of blacklists](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet), in order to protect your application from malicious inputs.

#### 8.2 - Performance Intensive Applications

Regex matching speeds can range from not-very-fast to extremely slow, depending on [how well the expression is written](https://www.loggly.com/blog/regexes-the-bad-better-best/).  This is fine for most use cases, especially if the text being matched is very short (such as an email address form).  For high-performance server applications, however, regex can be a performance bottleneck, especially if expression is poorly written or the text being searched is long.

#### 8.3 - For Problems That Don't Require Regex

Regex is an incredibly useful tool, but that doesn't mean you should use it everywhere.

If there is an alternative solution to a problem, which is simpler and/or does not require the use of regular expressions, **please do not use regex just to feel clever**.  Regex is great, but it is also one of the least readable programming tools, and one that is very prone to edge cases and bugs.

Overusing regex is a great way to make your co-workers (and anyone else who needs to work with your code) very angry with you.

## Conclusion

I hope that this has been a useful introduction to the many uses of regular expressions.

There still are lots of regex use cases that we have not covered.  For instance, [regex can be used in PostgreSQL queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-matching.html) to dynamically search for text patterns within a database.

We have also left lots of powerful regex syntax features uncovered, such as [lookahead, lookbehind](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html), [atomic groups](https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html), [recursion](https://www.regular-expressions.info/recurse.html), and [subroutines](https://www.regular-expressions.info/subroutine.html).
